<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
<p>ANSWER: Good things to keep in mind for wireframes is to keep it focused on frontend features. Wireframes help people to create an idea of what they would like to create. So, it is important to be able to create quick wireframes solely focused on frontend. You can plan out things and features. A wireframe makes it easy for people to visualize what they would like to do and follow when creating a site.</p>

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
<p>ANSWER: User testing helps to decide how a website can best meet the user needs. Companies can decide what is important for their users and how they can design a site around it. User testing is often used by companies, and we can even see this with Collegeboard always asking us about our experience at the bottom of a page.</p>

<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>

<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>
<p>ANSWER: Selectors allows us to be able to select certain types of elements which you want to style in a particular fashion. This is useful in helping us not have to redefine traits for each instance of an element. One selector which we use is the element selector, which allows us to select all of the element on the page. One element selector we can use is <"p">, which allows us to select all of the paragraph elements on a page.</p>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
<p>ANSWER: The selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game allows us to properly access the game. Selection is used to check whether the snake has eaten the apple or it has hit its head based on the position of values. The iteration allows the program to make sure that the snake is the correct length. Sequencing is visible in the program by having the program run in the specific order in order to be able to have the function work properly.</p>
<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>
<p>ANSWER: ":root" contributes to the customization of a game by getting the root elements of the game and then being able to define colors for the snake and the apple. It defines set variables for the game.</p>
<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>
<p>ANSWER: HTML, Javascript, and CSS combine in order to be able to create a good looking website. In order to be able to have interactive elements on the page, we need to write Javascript code. In order to have elements on the page, we need to create an HTML layout. And to style how these elements look, we need to be able to write CSS code.</p>
